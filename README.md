## Description

This program will allow the user to take typical coding assessment includes both mulitple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

The motivation behind creating this project is to test users knowledge of JavaScript. 

What I learn from this project is re-building my mindset. First to plan out what the website need to look like, then plan out section and what need to be down.
Also, to double check opening and closing code and typos. The main problem I had with this project is deploying and making it work. 

## Acceptance Criteria

- click start button
- timer starts and present questions
- user answer question

- IF question is answer incorrectly
- THEN timer is subtracted from the clock
- all question are answer or timer reach 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initial and my score
